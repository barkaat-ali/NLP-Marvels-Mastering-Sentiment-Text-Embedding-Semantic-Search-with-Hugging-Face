631609,1842923,10,wedding,i kept getting complements all evening the color was perfect for a day wedding and evening reception i wore it with nude heels and simple jewelry the beading around the neckline is enough but it wouldve been lovely with a diamond necklace as welllilly doesnt disappoint when it comes to the cut and fit of their dresses this fit wonderfully and the cut provided an hour glass shape that looks great on all shapes and sizes you can wear with regular under garments and the dress while form fitting never felt tight even while dancing i was so sad to send this one back,dress,"5' 2""",20,31.0,May 05 2019

897040,814116,4,wedding,this dress was sent to me as a backup and i didnt end up wearing it as it was not a good fit for me it fit around my waist but was very tight then the top of the dress was very loose on my boobs it was actually uneven on top too one side sticking out a little bit more than the other as you can see in the picture mostly i just thought the overall look was very unflattering it was longer than i thought it would be too and hit at an awkward place right above the knee instead of looking like a voluminous mini skirt i wish it looked the way it does in the picture but it didnt on me ,dress,"5' 7""",16,32.0,Jul 05 2022

790516,167112,10,wedding,this dress is lovely i rented it for a hip yet formal fall wedding two of our closest friends were getting married and my husband was asked to officiate in order to play “preacher’s wife” i feel like i had to step up my gameafter dressing like a disgruntled office worker to the first wedding i attended as an adult i’ve spent years attempting to undo this mistake with mostly vintage dresses or rewearing the same few dillards jams over and over desperately trying to style them into something fresh enter rtr and this lil beautypros gorgeous detail lace for days great length for a formal affair where you don’t want to show your lady business beautiful open back and delicate chest detail love the two pintucks on the front also really fun to style—it’s somewhat conservative on the body but took really kindly to punk and vintage styling tons of compliments looks pretty with pearls as well awesome to dance in both top and bottom parts of the dress let you move without anything falling outcons i’m gifted in the booty department so i was a little bummed to not have a more defined bum the waist was defining but not as dramatic as i would have liked i also have a smaller chest and found that i needed to wear a bra just to add some oomph to the top the lace also may snag on a friend’s dangly earrings or a purse chain so watch outhmm there’s a bustierinlay whose inner clasp was broken when it arrived but i was able to make it work without iti’m still giving this thing abecause i loved my rtr experience and i see this dress in my dreams we already miss each other come back to me shoshanna dress ,dress,"5' 7""",4,36.0,Nov 12 2018
