# NLP Marvels: Mastering Sentiment, Text Embedding, and Semantic Search with Hugging Face

## Overview
Welcome to the "NLP Marvels" project! This hands-on guide walks you through key Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using Hugging Face. Master sentiment analysis, text embedding, and semantic search with real-world data from the "Rent the Runway" dataset.

## Project Highlights

**Task 0: Setup**
- Import essential Python packages: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Transformers, Sentence Transformers.

**Task 1: Import the Runway Data**
- Load "Rent the Runway" dataset, exploring user and item identifiers, ratings, review text, and metadata.

**Task 2: Preprocessing the `review_text`**
- Clean review text by removing special characters, punctuation, digits, and extra spaces. Convert to lowercase.

**Task 3: Sentiment Analysis on `review_text_cleaned`**
- Use Hugging Face's sentiment analysis pipeline to categorize cleaned review text as positive or negative.

**Task 4: Histogram of Sentiment Score**
- Visualize sentiment score distribution with a histogram.

**Task 5: Sentiment Over the Years**
- Explore sentiment evolution over the years with a bar plot.

**Task 6: Does Cleaning Text Matter?**
- Compare sentiment analysis results between cleaned and non-cleaned review text.

**Task 7: Embeddings**
- Dive into text embeddings using Hugging Face's Sentence Transformers.

**Task 8: Clustering**
- Apply dimensionality reduction (t-SNE) to visualize clusters in embeddings.

**Task 9: Visualizing the Clusters**
- Build a scatterplot to represent clusters formed by embeddings.

**Task 10: Semantic Search**
- Implement a semantic search pipeline to find items similar to a given query.

**Task 11: Generate New Marketing Material**
- Use Hugging Face's GPT-2 model to generate creative marketing material based on a prompt.
